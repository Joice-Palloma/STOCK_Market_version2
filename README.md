## Patterns Chosen

The patterns chosen for this project are Observer, Iterator and Singleton (DAO)

* Observer Design Pattern

According to Howtodoinjava(2016) the observer pattern defines a one-to-many dependency between objects as a result when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically. 

In observer pattern, there are many observers (subscriber objects) that are observing a particular subject (publisher object). Observers register themselves to a subject to get a notification when there is a change made inside that subject.

A observer object can register or unregister from subject at any point of time. It helps is making the objects objects loosely coupled.

For all the caracteristics mentioned above I chose the Observer Pattern for the company, to keep track ok the information that will be updated , also to update and check the updated values for a few fields.



* Iterator Pattern

As stated by Howtodoinjava(2016) the behavioral design pattern iterator provides a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation. 

As name implies, iterator helps in traversing the collection of objects in a defined manner which is useful the client applications. During iteration, client programs can perform various other operations on the elements as per requirements.



* Singleton
